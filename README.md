# BioMap

Map based biological monitoring

BioMap is a one page web application base on server side Blazor. It uses the [Blazorise](https://github.com/stsrki/Blazorise) 
and [ChartJs.Blazor](https://github.com/mariusmuntean/ChartJs.Blazor) libraries.

The web app has been developped for a nature protection project in Germany. The population of yellow-bellied toads (bombina 
variegate) is studied in a forest area in Bavaria and observed over a longer period of time. By regularly catching and identifying 
toads, growth and migration movements of individuals are recorded. The results are processed numerically and graphically.
